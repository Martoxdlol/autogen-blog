# Autogen Blog

Automatic generated content

## What is this about?

This is a "blog" or something. All the content is generated by AI. This is only an expermient.
I will add multilanguage support with AI translation in the future.

## Setup

- Clone directory
- Install dependencies
- Use firebase cli to setup GitHub actions for automatic deployments (optional)
- Setup env openai key (see example.env)
- Setup firebase app service account
- Push to your GitHub repo and/or build and deploy to Firebase!

## Content generation

Using variables **MAX_CATEGORIES**, **MAX_POST_PER_CATEGORY** and **MAX_AUTHORS**, it will generate the content starting with authors, categories and then posts, to fill the max amount. If some document is deleter or a vraiable is agumented it will only generate the remaining quantity. Also, generation is disabled on github actions by default. Feel free to change that.

Check **/src/data/generatos.ts** and **/src/data/data.ts** to understand content generation
